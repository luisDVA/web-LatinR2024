## Tutorial Satellite Data Analysis in R

#### Learn how to perform satellite data analysis with R combined with Machine Learninig techniques.

### About the course

**Date** November 18, 2024, 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM (GMT-3)

**Mode**: Online

**Enrollment**: [https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1045614801017](https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1045614801017)

Satellite data analysis in R, combined with Machine Learning techniques, opens new opportunities to interpret and leverage geospatial information.
This tutorial will address practical applications using R to process and analyze satellite imagery. It will demonstrate how to take advantage of specialized libraries in R, such as raster, sf and caret, to manipulate spatial data and build predictive models. The use of Machine Learning will allow the identification of patterns in large satellite data sets, applying algorithms such as decision trees, SVM and Random Forest.
Real examples in fields such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring and land surface change detection will be highlighted. The presentation will emphasize the importance of integrating satellite data in decision making and how these techniques allow a more efficient and accurate analysis of our environment from space.

## Tutorial: Working with larger than memory data in R with Arrow and DuckDB

#### Learn to analyze large datasets with Arrow, DuckDB & Duckplyr in R.Speed up workflows on your laptop using tidyverse-style data manipulation

### Sobre el curso

**Date** November 19, 2024, 10:00 AM - 12:00 AM (GMT-3)

**Mode**: Online

**Enrollment**: [https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1044938257457](https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1044938257457)

While datasets are growing larger, recent advances in technologies such as Apache Arrow and DuckDB are making the analysis of datasets that used to require complex infrastructure accessible to anyone.

Using the {arrow}, {duckdb}, and {duckplyr} packages opens up the door to analyzing gigabytes of data in seconds using the same interface as with the {tidyverse}. By learning just a few concepts, R users can enjoy working easily with larger-than-memory datasets directly from their everyday computer.
In this tutorial, will analyze real data to explore formats used to store these large datasets on disks, how Arrow and DuckDB can be leveraged to analyze data, and how these tools integrate with the {tidyverse} interface.

After attending this tutorial, learners will:
  - Understand when using Arrow or DuckDB can help speed up a data analysis
  - Describe how Arrow and DuckDB can work with datasets that are larger than memory
  - Recognize the type of data manipulations that benefit the most from leveraging tools like Arrow and DuckDB
  - Decide which package ({arrow}, {duckdb}, or {duckplyr}) is best suited for their data analysis
  - Develop their own data analysis using Arrow or DuckDB

This tutorial is aimed at everyone who needs to analyze datasets that are larger than the memory they have available on their everyday computer or who is interested in learning how to speed up the analysis of large datasets.
Participants who don’t have access to HPC will particularly benefit from this tutorial as the tools used can easily be installed on a regular laptop and provide good performance.

### Requirements.
Participants should already be familiar with data manipulation with the {tidyverse} (knowing how to use the 5 most common {dplyr} verbs for data analysis: mutate(), select(), filter(), summarize(), arrange() combined with group_by()).

**Software**: R >= 4.1.0
**packages**: arrow, duckdb, duckplyr, tidyverse, tictoc.

## Tutorial Take your graphs with ggplot2 to the next level

#### Learn how to create clear, informative and captivating visualizations for your data analysis.

### About the course

**Date** November 19th, 2024, 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM (GMT-3)

**Mode**: Online

**Enrollment**: [https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1045608201277](https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/1045608201277)

Creating clear, informative and captivating visualizations is an undisputed endeavor within data analytics, both within academia and industry. However, the vast majority of tutorials or initial R courses tend to only explain how the ggplot2 graph grammar works, without covering the potential of the aesthetic parameters that help to nonverbally communicate the graph's objective. In this workshop we will show how to edit text and colors, both specifically and from the use of palettes, and how to adapt the chart to specific publication criteria.

#### General learning objective:
Participants can adapt their graphics to the publication requirements of a journal or other academic format.

### Specific learning objectives:
Participants can modify the textual elements of the graphics.
Participants can edit the appearance of graphics both by selecting specific colors and using palettes.
Participants can specify the export dimensions of graphics.

The tutorial is intended for a wide audience looking to take their graphics to the next level by customizing labels and text, colors and details of the graphics, especially to prepare them in the best way for presentations or publications. In particular, this workshop aims to help those who know how to make a basic graphic, but are unable to adapt it to their specific needs or to get the graphic to show exactly what they want.

### Requirements

In order to be able to follow the tutorial activities smoothly, it is necessary to have some experience, even if it is initial, with R and RStudio and with the ggplot2 package.

You should have a computer with R and R Studio installed and up to date. They should also install the tidyverse package, which includes the ggplot2 package, which is what the course will be about.

### Objectives:
  1. to present the theoretical bases of the models that can be used;
  2. discuss the advantages and limitations of the models in the context of different applications;
  3. to introduce the ways of correctly conducting an ecological niche or species distribution modeling study for various purposes;
  4. Initiate the use of geographic distribution modeling of species using R;

Students, researchers and professionals at any stage of their career with an interest in developing and applying species distribution and/or ecological niche models in a reproducible and automated way. Participants should be used to working with computers, have a good internet connection and preferably a webcam, as the live online sessions are intended to be highly interactive. Previous basic experience with R is strongly desirable, although not strictly mandatory. All R scripts will be provided and explained in detail.
