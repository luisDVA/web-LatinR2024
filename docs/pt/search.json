    "text": "“I’m just a political scientist, standing in front of the R console asking it to help me finish my thesis.”\nIt was 2015, a Political Science master’s student had to process data to hand in his thesis and decided to take the opportunity to learn how to use R. To the long and winding road of the academic requirement was added an extra degree of difficulty: incorporating programming software from scratch, with a somewhat steep learning curve.\nYears later, as I review scripts from the thesis code, I smile to see long lines of code to recode variables with a structure like this:\nLooking at it in perspective (like my scripts) I can say that learning R was the best decision I made in my professional career.\nR Since then it has become a fundamental tool in my daily life: As academic in my work as a consultant and analyst; in my role as a public servant; in my spare time, as a hobby; and in my current role, coordinating the Data team at Fundar, a think tank that studies and formulates public policies for the sustainable and inclusive development of Argentina.\nOf all the qualities that R has, the community was the determining factor in my journey with this programming language.\nWhile I was finishing the first step of the thesis, I found out about the organization of the first Latin American Conference on R for R&D (LatinR) to which I owe my second (and third… and umpteenth) step in my relationship with R. In the first conference I presented use cases for political analyses from R, implementing grids from Argentina to use with ggplot as if they were maps with geofacet. In the second conference, we presented the Shiny App Electoral Intelligence for the analysis of electoral results in Argentina and I was able to participate in the Package Development workshop with Hadley Wickham. This was the ideal starting point to get started with the idea of packaging code myself."

    "text": "The polAr Universe\nAlthough originally the package sought to facilitate access and tools for the analysis of electoral data in Argentina, over time, other workflows and data sources (geographic, presidential speeches, and legislative votes) were integrated, with an increase in dependencies and difficulty in managing more and more functions. This was a problematic issue that was discussed with colleagues in the Package Development panel during the third LatinR confernce (2020).\n\n\n\nLatinR Confernce (2022) - Package Development Ronund Table\n\n\npolAr had reached 4000 downloads when I received an email from the CRAN team informing me that I had to fix a policy violation to prevent the package from being archived. DUnfortunately my submitted fix did not appear to correct the problem and the package was archived.\n\n\n\nThe polarverse\n\n\nIf the conversation at LatinR made me think about splitting polAr into multiple packages as a possibility, the CRAN archiving gave me the opportunity to do so. The decision was to generate independent workflows; a strategy that made it possible to move forward at different paces, making specific decisions for each topic, trying to address it at the same time as part of a whole, emulating the Tidyverse paradigm: a similar philosophy and grammar of operation for the collection of packages. The goal was to improve the development of that which led to the archiving of polAr.\nI presented “Divide and Conquer: from {polAr} to the polarverse at the fourth edition of LatinR, showcasing this new universe with five packages:\n\n📦 opinAr: provides access to data on public opinion and government in Argentina based on the Confidence in Government Index published monthly by the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.\n📦 electorAr: facilitates access to electoral data for Argentina (for different levels and with different spatial aggregation) and functions to compute relevant indicators.\n📦 legislAr: facilitates downloading disaggregated information of votes in the legislative chambers of Argentina, originating from the project Decade Voted project by Andy Tow.\n📦 discursAr: is designed to obtain data on political speeches. In principle, it provides access to presidential speeches in legislative assemblies at the inauguration of ordinary sessions.\n📦 geoAr: allows access to data and tools for spatial workflows from within R. One paper on the package was accepted for the sixth edition of LatinR conference (2023).\n\nIn addition, we worked on an auxiliary library called polarViz to facilitate the visualization of the other packages, and a metapackage called polArversethat emulates the operation of tidyverse for loading the set of associated libraries."

Undoubtedly, it is an important tool for better maintenance.\n\n\n\npolAr R-Universe\n\n\n\nWe continue to take important steps for our universe:\nFirst, we returned to CRAN! In February 2023, we shipped geoAr, which, as noted, provides access to and facilitates the processing of spatially relevant data. A version under development (accessible from the R-Universe) also allows you to interact with the API of the Argentine Geographic Data Standardization Service (Servicio de Normalización de Datos Geográficos de Argentina.\nOn the other hand, I added a pending tool to the polAr toolbox to work with census data: censAr. The package, currently under development, is based on the code from censo2017 developed by Mauricio “Pacha” Vargas and part of the rOpenSci suite."

It certainly made the process much easier.\nI think it is possible to make improvements to the process; to support CRAN becoming an even better space for the R ecosystem and to make the R development experience more enjoyable and predictable.\nThe R-Universe project to enhance the publishing and discovery experience of packages developed in R is invaluable.\n\nThe polarverse was a side project where I worked in my free time and without funding. It emerged almost playfully, as an experiment to learn how to develop software. We successfully published it in CRAN. We got frustrated and angry. We learned. We added new tools.\nNow, with the support and encouragement provided by the great team at Fundar, in general, and the data area that I coordinate, in particular. We kept moving forward. Little by little. “Slowly, but steady”."

    "text": "Dear community:\nAs expected, the seriousness of the health situation in our region and the uncertainty it generates make it inevitable to cancel the on-site event in Montevideo. The in-person event in that city will be reschedule for 2021, on a date to be announced before the end of the year.\nOne of our goals in organizing LatinR has always been bringing together the Latin American R community, learning from the developments and research of its members, and generating bonds of collaboration and friendship. We do not want to lose that this year. In moments like these, having the opportunity to share with the community becomes even more valuable. That is why we have decided to organize an online activity on the dates when the conference was originally planned (October 7-9). We are still ironing out the characteristics of the event, so we hope to announce during the next weeks both the details of this activity, and the modes of participation.\nIn the meantime, take care.\nSee you (virtually) in October!\nLatinR 2020 organizing team"

En este blog post, queremos destacar estas iniciativas y recordarle a todxs que estamos más que dispuestxs a ayudarles a empezar organizaciones similares en sus comunidades locales.\n\n\nLatinR: LatinR es una conferencia internacional trilingüe para el uso de R en la investigación y desarrollo en América Latina. Desde 2018, nuestra conferencia ha sido un punto de partida para nuevos paquetes, nuevos grupos de usuarixs locales, clubes de lectura, capítulos de R-Ladies, traducciones y otras iniciativas en la región.\nConectaR: ConectaR 2019 tuvo lugar del 24 al 26 de enero de 2019 en la Universidad de Costa Rica, en San José, Costa Rica. Fue el primer evento en Centroamérica avalado por la R Foundation, y se realizó completamente en español. Puedes encontrar más información aquí.\nsatRday: satRday es una conferencia sobre R y sus aplicaciones, que ocurre en todo el mundo, y que cuyos eventos son organizados por la comunidad local. Tuvimos dos eventos de satRdays en América Latina: en Santiago - Chile y São Paulo - Brasil. Si quieres organizar un evento de satRday en cualquier lugar en América Latina, ¡por favor ponte en contacto para que nos podamos ayudar mutamente!\nR-Ladies: R-Ladies es una organización global que promueve la diversidad de género en la comunidad R. Actualmente, tiene 123 capítulos activos en 51 países de todo el mundo, de los cuales en América Latina tenemos 49 capítulos en 10 países. Algunxs latinxs son parte del equipo global de R-Ladies, incluyendo su directiva. COVID-19 no ha detenido a R-Ladies. En cambio, hemos migrado nuestros eventos en línea y hemos creado alianzas entre los diferentes capítulos. Todo ha sido en un esfuerzo para proveer opciones para aprender R en ambientes seguros y de apoyo para así aumentar la diversidad de género en la comunidad de R. ¡Únete!\nrOpenSci: R para ciencia abierta, rOpenSci, brinda revisiones técnicas gratuitas de paquetes en R para mejorar la calidad del software de código abierto para maximizar legibilidad, facilidad de uso, utilidad y minimizar la redundancia. Su proceso de peer-review será prontamente traducido al español, ¡tú puedes involucrarte!\nCDSB: la Comunidad de Desarrolladores de Software de Bioinformática nació en 2018 con el objetivo de ayudar a usarixs de R latinxs en convertirse en desarrolladores de R & Bioconductor, además de aumentar la visibilidad de latinxs en estas comunidades. Para mayor información de la CDSB revisa bit.ly/cdsbpost2020 (en español).\nRUGs: hoy en día exiten varios Grupos de Usuarios de R (RUG en inglés) en América Latina, algunos de los cuales son oficiales y patrocinados por el R Consortium. La creación de un espacio acogedor y con buena onda es crucial para que las ideas fluyan. Esto no sólo asegura que todos se sientan cómodos aprendiendo y compartiendo lo que han aprendido, sino que también permite que aparezcan nuevos proyectos inesperados. ¡Te podemos ayudar a empezar tu propio grupo!\nR4DS en español + el paquete datos: los recursos para aprender R en inglés son muchos, increíbles, en línea y gratuitos. Pero en América Latina pocas personas pueden darse el lujo de aprender inglés, y los recursos en español son pocos. Para ayudar a resolver este problema, como comunidad tradujimos del inglés al español el libro “R for Data Science” y desarrollamos un paquete con la traducción de todos los datos que se usan en el libro: datos. El flujo de trabajo para contribuir al paquete fue diseñado para involucrar a quienes quieran contribuir por primera vez, y ahora está guiando el desarrollo de una versión en portugués que se lanzará en los próximos meses.\n#DatosDeMiércoles + #30díasdegráficos: La cuenta de Twitter @R4DS_es fue creada como una forma de compartir proyectos como la traducción de R4DS y para desarrollar iniciativas para ir creciendo la comunidad de R de habla hispana, tales como #datosdemieRcoles, el primo latinoamericano de #TidyTuesday. La idea no es solo utilizar conjuntos de datos en español, sino también conjuntos de datos que sean relevantes para las personas de nuestra Región. Esta iniciativa ha sido complementada por un desafío dataviz de 30 días llamado # 30díasdegráficos. Si deseas participar proponiendo un conjunto de datos para #datodemiéRcoles, visite nuestra cuenta de github.\nThe Carpentries: The Carpentries desarrolla capacidades esenciales globales en datos y habilidades computacionales para llevar a cabo una investigación eficiente, abierta y reproducible. La construcción de una comunidad sostenible y activa en América Latina incluye varias iniciativas: traducción de lecciones, capacitación de instructores, coordinación de talleres y recaudación de fondos. Ponte en contacto a través de la lista de correo y en el Slack de Carpentries, canal carpentries-es.\nReproHack: ReproHack es una comunidad que está creciendo, conformada por investigadores que están luchando contra la crisis de reproducibilidad al compartir sus experiencias de diferentes disciplinas. Se enfoca en organizar hackathones donde los participantes intenta reproducir un artículo de investigación publicado a partir de una lista de artículos propuestos, que tengan los datos y el código público. Estamos planificando el primer Reprohack en español para octubre de este año y puedes ponerte en contacto a través de Twitter.\nAI Inclusive: AI Inclusive es una organización que promueve la diversidad en la Comunidad de Inteligencia Artificial (IA; AI en inglés). Queremos crear conciencia sobre los problemas de Inteligencia Artificial y empoderar a la comunidad para que puedan ingresar en el campo de la IA, un campo que no es para nada diverso. En Diciembre 2019, tuvimos nuestros eventos de lanzamiento en Río de Janeiro, Brasil y San Francisco, California. Juntos, estamos construyendo una comunidad para hacer que la Inteligencia Artificial sea más inclusiva para todxs. ¡Síguenos y únete a nosotrxs!\nData Latam: en mayo del 2016 arrancamos con el primer podcast de Data Latam con el objetivo de ofrecer a gente interesada un punto de acceso fácil y en español al mundo de la ciencia de datos. Siempre le preguntamos a lxs entrevistadxs “¿cómo llegaste a donde estás?”, y la diversidad de historias ha sido enorme. Hoy en día Data Latam es una comunidad Latinoamericana de profesionales y académicxs aplicando ciencia de datos en su día a día. ¡Te invitamos a participar!\n\nLo que pasa en la comunidad R, no se queda en la comunidad R. Todas las buenas prácticas de comunidades inclusivas y diversas aprendidas en muchas de las iniciativas presentadas anteriormente, generan equipos de trabajo fuertes dentro de la comunidad R y fuera de ella. Aún hay mucho que hacer, pero lo que ya hemos logrado es muy alentador y provee bases muy sólidas para el futuro.\nEstas iniciativas son sostenidas por muchas personas que hacen un gran esfuerzo detrás de escena, que es principalmente voluntario. Algunos de los desafíos que enfrentan las comunidades se traducen en múltiples aspectos positivos, sostenidos y mucho trabajo duro invisible. Algunos son: buscar financiamiento internacional porque el financiamiento regional es limitado, traducir contenido, unir fuerzas a través de organizaciones, organizar conferencias regionales, convertirse en desarrolladores de la tecnología.\nLa comunidad de R en América Latina está creciendo rápidamente y también la responsabilidad de hacer que este crecimiento sea sólido y seguro. Algunos de los trabajos futuros que nosotrxs, como constructores de la comunidad, esperamos cumplir son: consolidar las conferencias regionales con el apoyo de patrocinadores internacionales; adquirir apoyo para mantener los proyectos de traducción; amplificar la voz de las minorías regionales; importar material educativo y oportunidades de trabajo; conectar a expatriadxs con sus comunidades locales; ayudar a otros grupos como los RUGs y RLadies; colaborar con otras iniciativas como R-Forwards, Africa-R, MiR, entre otras; aumentar nuestra representación y la de otras minorías en el R Core Team, la R Foundation y el R Consortium.\n¡Muchas gracias!

Al largo y tortuoso camino del requisito académico se agregó un grado de dificultad extra: incorporar un software de programación desde cero, con una curva de aprendizaje algo empinada.\nAños después reviso scripts del código de la tesis y me sonrío al ver extensas líneas de código para recodificar variables con esta una estructura como esta:\nMirando en restropectiva, como a mis scripts, aprender R fue la mejor decisión que tomé en mi carrera profesional.\nR desde entonces en una herramienta fundamental de mi día a día. Lo es en el ámbito académico y como docente universitario; en mis trabajos como consultor y analista; en mis tareas como funcionario público; en mis ratos libres, como un pasatiempo; y en mi trabajo actual, coordinando el equipo de Datos de Fundar, un think tank que estudia y elabora políticas públicas para el desarrollo sostenible e inclusivo de Argentina.\nDe todas las cualidades que tiene R, la comunidad fue el factor determinante en mi recorrido con este lenguaje de programación.\nAl tiempo que finalizaba el primer paso de la tesis, me enteraba de la organización de la primera Conferencia Latinoamericana de R para I+D (LatinR), comunidad a la que le debo mi segundo (y tercero… y enesimo) paso en mi relación con R. En la primera conferencia presenté casos de uso para análisis político desde R, implementando grillas de Argentina para usar con ggplot como si fueran mapas con geofacet. En la segunda conferencia, presentamos la Shiny App Inteligencia Electoral para el análisis de resultados electorales de Argentina y pude participar del taller Desarrollo de Paquetes con Hadley Wickham. Fue éste el punto de partida ideal para empezar con la idea de empaquetar código yo mismo."

Y el aprendizaje de cómo desarrollar paquetes, en tiempos de confinamiento y muchas horas frente a la computadora, convirtieron el trabajo de procesamiento de datos electorales, de mi vida como politólogo y consultor, en un nuevo paquete: polAr; que el 16 de mayo de 2020 viajaba a CRAN."

    "text": "El universo polAr\nSi bien originalmente el paquete buscaba facilitar el acceso y herramientas para el análisis de datos electorales en Argentina, con el tiempo se fueron integrando otros flujos de trabajo y fuentes de datos (geográficos, discursos presidenciales y votaciones legislativas), con un incremento de dependencias y dificultad para administrar cada vez más funciones. Esto fue un tema relevante que discutimos en el panel Desarrollo de paquetes durante la tercera conferencia de LatinR (2020).\n\n\n\nLatinR Confernce (2022) - Mesa Redonda de Desarrollo de Paquetes\n\n\npolAr había alcanzado las 4000 descargas cuando recibo un correo electrónico del equipo de CRAN informando que debía ajustar una violación de política para que el paquete no fuera archivado. A pesar de enviar una nueva versión el paquete fue archivado sin una clara razón.\n\n\n\nEl polarverse\n\n\nSí la conversación en LatinR nos hizo pensar en la separación en múltiples paquetes como posibilidad, el archivado de CRAN nos dio la oportunidad de hacerlo. Le decisión fue generar flujos independientes de trabajo; estrategia que posibilitó poder ir avanzando con distintos ritmos, tomando decisiones específicas para cada tema, procurando abordarlo al mismo tiempo como parte de un conjunto, emulando el paradigma Tidyverse: una filosofía y gramática de funcionamiento similar para la colección de paquetes. El objetivo fue mejorar el desarrollo de aquello que derivó en el archivado de {polAr}.\nPresentamos “Divide y Vencerás: de {polAr} al polarverse” en la cuarta conferencia de LatinR, mostrando este nuevo universo con cinco paquetes:\n\n📦 opinAr: da acceso a datos de opinión pública y de gobierno de Argentina a partir del Indice de Confianza en el Gobierno que publica mensualmente la Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.\n📦 electorAr facilita el acceso datos electorales de Argentina (para distintos niveles y con diferente agregación espacial) y funciones para computar indicadores relevantes.\n📦 legislAr: permite descargar información desagregada de votaciones en las cámaras legislativas de Argentina, originadas por el proyecto Década Votada de Andy Tow.\n📦 discursAr: pensado para obtener datos relativos a discursos políticos. En principio proveyendo acceso a discursos presidenciales en asambleas legislativas de inauguración de sesiones ordinarias.\n📦 geoAr: permite acceder a datos y herramientas para flujos de trabajo espaciales desde R. Una ponencia sobre el paquete fue aceptada para la sexta conferencia de LatinR.\n\nAdicionalmente trabajamos en una librería auxiliar llamada polarViz, para facilitar la tarea de visualización de los otros paquetes, y un metapaquete polArverseque emula el funcionamiento de tidyverse, para la carga del conjunto de librerías asociadas."

Sin duda R-Universe es una herramienta relevante para el mejor mantenimiento del polArverse.\n\n\n\npolAr R-Universe\n\n\n\nSeguimos dando pasos importantes para nuestro universo:\nEn primer lugar, ¡volvimos a CRAN! En febrero de 2023 se envío geoAr que, como señalamos, permite acceder y facilitar el procesamiento de datos con relevancia espacial. Una versión en desarrollo (accesible desde r-universe) permite también interactuar con la API del Servicio de Normalización de Datos Geográficos de Argentina.\nPor otro lado, incoporamos un histórico pendiente a la caja de herramientas polAr para trabajar con datos censales: censAr. El paquete,  actualmente en desarrollo, está basado en el código de censo2017, desarrollado por Mauricio “Pacha” Vargas y parte de la suite de rOpenSci."

Sin lugar a dudas facilitando mucho el proceso.\nCreo que es posible pensar en mejoras del proceso para hacer de CRAN un espacio mejor aún para el ecosistema R y hacer de la experiencia de desarrollo FOSS mas amena y predecible.\nEl surgimiento del proyecto R-Universe para mejorar la experiencia de publicación y descubrimiento de paquetes desarrollados en R resulta muy valioso.\n\nEl polarverse fue un proyecto paralelo en el que trabajé en mis momentos libres y sin financiamiento. Surgió casi lúdicamente, como un experimento para aprender a desarrollar software. Probamos exitosamente la publicación en CRAN. Nos frustramos y enojamos. Aprendimos. Sumamos nuevas herramientas.\nSeguimos avanzando. De a poco. Ahora, con el apoyo y estimulo que supone en gran equipo de Fundar, en general, y del área de datos que me toca coordinar, en particular. “Lento, pero seguro”.\n(Publicado originalmente en rOpenSci, 05/12/2023)"

    "text": "Palestras\n\nJulia Silge: What is “production” anyway? MLOps for the curious\nWhile data scientists are often taught about training a machine learning model, building an MLOps strategy to deploy and maintain that model can be daunting. You may have even heard that R is not appropriate for production use. In this talk, learn what the practice of machine learning operations (MLOps) is, what principles can be used to create a practical MLOps strategy, what people mean when they say “production”, and what kinds of tasks and components are involved. See how to get started with vetiver, a framework for MLOps tasks in R (and Python) that provides fluent tooling to version, deploy, and monitor your models. This talk will help practitioners who are already deploying models, but this is also useful knowledge for data science practitioners earlier in their MLOps journey; decisions made along the way can make the difference between resilient models that are easier to maintain and disappointing or misleading models."

    "text": "¡ENVÍO CERRADO!\n\n\n  La sexta versión de la conferencia se llevará a cabo em Montevideo, Uruguay, entre los días 18 y 20 de octubre. En esta edición se podrá participar con presentaciones orales, charlas relámpagos y pósters.\n\n\nTópicos de interés\nLos temas sugeridos para esta edición son los siguientes:\n\nAplicaciones de R en distintas disciplinas de la academia y la industria. Todos los campos del conocimiento y sus combinaciones son de interés.\nDesarrollo de nuevos paquetes R\nUso innovador de paquetes R existentes\nUso de R en la enseñanza\nIniciativas innovadoras para el aprendizaje de R\nDiseño de experimentos usando R\nInvestigación reproducible usando R\nAnálisis de grandes datos con R\nAprendizaje automático con R\nVisualización de datos con R\nAnálisis de redes con R\nUsos de R en el servicio público\nUso de R para análisis de datos abiertos\nUso de R en conjunto con otros lenguajes de programación y plataformas\n\n\n\nTe puedes registrar utilizando eventbrite en este link seleccionando el tipo de ticket correspondiente.\n\n\n\n\nModalidades de presentación\n\nComunicaciones Orales\nComunicaciones sobre resultados de trabajos de investigación, estados de avance o desarrollos específicos que, por su originalidad o potencial aplicación e impacto en el uso o desarrollo de R en la academia o la industria, resulten de interés para la comunidad regional de R. Quienes participen en esta modalidad dispondrán de 20 minutos para la presentación y 5 minutos para diálogo con el público. \n\n\nCharlas relámpago\nLas charlas relámpago proporcionan una oportunidad para presentar y discutir avances, ideas, investigaciones en curso, experiencias y desafíos relacionados a los ejes temáticos de LatinR. Quienes participen de esta modalidad dispondrán de 5 minutos para la presentación. Las charlas relámpago se agruparán en sesiones temáticas que incluirán espacio al final para una ronda de preguntas. \n\n\nPósters\nAl igual que las charlas relámpago, los pósters proporcionan una oportunidad para presentar avances y proyectos en curso relacionados a los ejes temáticos de LatinR. Durante la conferencia habrá un bloque horario destinado a la presentación de pósters y al diálogo con el público asistente. \n\n\n\nConsideraciones sobre el envío de propuestas\n\nTodos los trabajos deberán enviarse en formato PDF, sin autores ni filiación, en tamaño carta, escritos en fuente tamaño 11 a espacio simple. La extensión no puede superar las dos páginas.\nExiste un paquete desarrollado por Elio Campitelli que permite elaborar el resumen en un archivo RMarkdown. Puedes revisar los detalles en en este post. En ediciones anteriores de la conferencia era posible hacer el envío directamente desde R. En esta ocasión eso no es posible ya que la plataforma no es la misma. Si prefieres utilizar un procesador de textos, te pedimos que por favor uses esta plantilla para el envío.\nLos trabajos deben enviarse a través de la plataforma Open Review. Es necesario registrarse en ella para poder hacer el envío. Es importante tener en consideración que el registro no es automático; puede tomar hasta 24 horas en quedar habilitada la cuenta. Se sugiere no dejar la creación de la cuenta para el último minuto.\nEn el caso de los trabajos con autoría compartida, basta con que una persona del equipo se haya registrado en Open Review.\nEs posible enviar un solo trabajo como autor/a principal. Sin embargo, es posible participar como co-autor/a en otros dos trabajos.\nTodos los trabajos serán revisados cuidadosamente por los miembros del Comité Científico (a anunciar próximamente), teniendo en cuenta su originalidad, aporte, calidad técnica y claridad.\n\n\n\n\nFechas importantes\nInicio recepción de trabajos: 2 de mayo de 2023\nFecha límite para la recepción de propuestas: 30 de junio de 2023\nNotificación resultados evaluación: principios de agosto 2023\n\nPresentaciones y pósters versiones anteriores\nEn nuestro canal de YouTube es posible revisar los videos de las ediciones 2020 a 2022 de LatinR.

    "title": "Paquete latinr para crear y enviar trabajos a LatinR",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Presentando: latinr, el paquete\nEn esta edición de LatinR estrenamos una nueva forma de enviar trabajos enteramente desde la sesión de R!\nLa idea es facilitar lo más posible todo el proceso de creación, formato y envío de trabajos. Con el paquete latinr podrán escribir la presentación con R Markdown agregando los detalles en el header, compilar a PDF usando el estilo de la conferencia y enviarlo sin tener que llenar ningún formulario.\nEs importante aclarar que usar el paquete no es obligatorio en absoluto. Quien no se sienta cómode con R Markdown puede usar cualquier herramienta que quiera para crear su PDF y quien prefiera usar la inferfaz web de EasyChair, puede hacerlo sin problema.\nUna segunda aclaración es que el envío de trabajos mediante el paquete todavía es un poco experimental, por lo que les pedimos que si lo usan, vayan a la web para cerciorarse de que todo haya salido correctamente.\n\nCómo usar latinr para crear trabajos a LatinR\nLo primero de todo es, por supuesto, instalar el paquete. Esto pueden hacerlo con el comando devtools::install_github(\"latinr/latinr\").\nSi usan RStudio, pueden ir a Archivo -&gt; Nuevo Archivo -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; Desde Plantilla y ahí seleccionar “LatinR submission article”. Ahí ponen el nombre de su presentación y la carpeta dónde quieren crearla y al darle OK se les creará un archivo base que pueden empezar a completar.\nVan a ver que todos los datos de envío van en el encabezado del archivo. Pueden llenarlos a mano pero más fácil es usar el “wizard” con la funcion latinr::latinr_wizard(). Eso les ve a llevar a una interfaz gráfica donde pueden llenar sus datos y que al final les va a mostrar un encabezado yaml válido para copiar y pegar en su archivo.\n\n\n\nlatinr wizard\n\n\nAlternativamente pueden usar el wizard y darle al botón “Save” en la esquina superior derecha y eso les va a crear el mismo archivo base pero con los datos completados. En cualquier caso, el archivo R Markdown les va a quedar algo así:\n\n\n\nlatinr file skeleton\n\n\nEl primer chunk del documento chequea que la metadata esté más o menos correcta cada vez que se renderiza el archivo. Recomendamos no editarlo para que cualquier error salga a la luz lo antes posible. El resto es el documento de R Markdown de prueba. Pueden tratar de “knitear” este archivo de prueba para estar seguro que su instalación de LaTeX está en orden y luego comenzar a preparar su presentación para LatinR!\n\n\nCómo enviar el artículo\nHasta acá latinr les permite crear un PDF con la plantilla de la conferencia y correctamente anonimizado para el envío. Pueden enviar ese PDF manualmente entrando a la página de EasyChair, pero si quieren, pueden hacerlo usando latinr.\nEn cualquier caso, van a tener que hacerse una cuenta en EasyChair. Luego, tienen la opción de guardar sus datos de cuenta latinr::latinr_password_set(), que les va a pedir su usuario y su contraseña. Esto no es obligatorio pero facilita las cosas. Es posible que necesiten instalar el paquete keyring, en cuyo caso, les saldrá un error informativo.\nFinalmente el envío se realiza con latinr::latinr_submit(). Por default se fija si hay un único archivo con extensión .Rmd en su directorio de trabajo y, si así es, lo toma como el archivo a enviar. Luego, les muestra los detalles del envío para asegurarse de que esté todo bien, luego renderiza y muestra el archivo PDF para también asegurarse de que haya renderizado correctamente y finalmente hace el envío.\nOpcionalmente, si tienen el PDF renderizado de otro lado, pueden usar un .Rmd con el encabezado únicamente para los detalles (como el título, los nombres de les autores, etc…) y pasarle la ruta al archivo PDF que quieren enviar.\nComo dijimos antes, este proceso es relativamente experimental y la integración con formularios web es siempre complicada. Por eso, es muy importante ir a la página de EasyChair para chequear una última vez que todos los datos se hayan cargado correctamente y que el archivo haya sido subido bien. En caso de que haya algún problema, pueden corregirlo manualmente en la página.\n\n\nAbsolutamente opcional\nCada parte de todo este proceso es completamente opcional. Pueden usar latinr para crear y enviar su trabajo, sólo para crearlo, sólo para enviarlo o no usarlo en absoluto. ¡Hagan lo que les haga sentir más cómodes!\nPero si usan latinr y encuentran algún problema o tienen alguna sugerencia, ¡no duden en contactarnos! La mejor forma es abriendo un issue en el repositorio en GitHub o mandando un mensaje en nuestro Slack, o pueden enviarle un mail al maintainer del paquete usando packageDescription(\"latinr\")$Maintainer. Todo este proceso es nuevo para nosotros también y ojalá que con la comunidad podamos mejorarlo aún más!"

Reprogramaremos para 2021 la edición de la conferencia en esa ciudad, en una fecha que esperamos poder anunciar antes de fin de año.\nUna de nuestras motivaciones para organizar LatinR ha sido siempre la posibilidad de reunir a la comunidad Latinoamericana de R, aprender de los desarrollos e investigaciones de sus integrantes, y generar lazos de colaboración y amistad. No queremos perder eso este año. En momentos como los que estamos viviendo, tener la oportunidad de compartir con la comunidad se vuelve algo más valioso aún. Es por eso que hemos decidido organizar una actividad en línea en las fechas en las que originalmente estaba planeada la conferencia (7-9 de octubre). Aún estamos definiendo las características del evento, así que esperamos anunciar durante las próximas semanas tanto los detalles de esta actividad, como las modalidades de participación.\nMientras tanto, cuídense mucho.\n¡Nos vemos (virtualmente) en octubre!\nEquipo organizador LatinR 2020"

    "text": "Apresentando: latinr, o pacote\nNesta edição do LatinR, estrearemos uma nova forma de enviar trabalhos diretamente da sessão de R!\nA ideia é facilitar ao máximo todo o processo de criação, formatação e envio de trabalhos. Com o pacote latinr, você poderá escrever a submissão com R Markdown, adicionando os detalhes no header, compilar para PDF usando o estilo da conferência e enviá-lo sem precisar preencher nenhum formulário.\nÉ importante esclarecer que o uso do pacote não é obrigatório. Quem não se sentir confortável com R Markdown pode usar qualquer ferramenta que desejar para criar seu PDF, e quem preferir usar a interface web do EasyChair, pode fazê-lo sem problemas.\nUma segunda ressalva é que o envio de trabalhos por meio do pacote ainda é um pouco experimental, por isso pedimos que, se utilizarem, verifiquem no site se tudo foi enviado corretamente.\n\nComo usar o latinr para criar trabalhos para o LatinR\nA primeira coisa a fazer é, claro, instalar o pacote. Isso pode ser feito com o comando devtools::install_github(\"latinr/latinr\").\nSe você usar o RStudio, vá em Arquivo -&gt; Novo Arquivo -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; De Template e selecione “LatinR submission article”. Coloque o nome da sua apresentação e a pasta onde deseja criá-la. Ao clicar em OK, será criado um arquivo base que você pode começar a preencher.\nVocê verá que todos os dados de envio vão no cabeçalho do arquivo. Pode preenchê-los manualmente, mas é mais fácil usar o “wizard” com a função latinr::latinr_wizard(). Isso abrirá uma interface gráfica onde você pode preencher seus dados e, no final, será mostrado um cabeçalho YAML válido para copiar e colar no seu arquivo.\n\n\n\nlatinr wizard\n\n\nAlternativamente, você pode usar o wizard e clicar no botão “Save” no canto superior direito, o que criará o mesmo arquivo base, mas com os dados preenchidos. Em qualquer caso, o arquivo R Markdown ficará assim:\n\n\n\nlatinr file skeleton\n\n\nO primeiro chunk do documento verifica se a metadata está mais ou menos correta cada vez que o arquivo é renderizado. Recomendamos não editá-lo para que qualquer erro seja detectado o mais cedo possível. O restante é o documento de R Markdown de teste. Você pode tentar renderizar o arquivo (“knit”) de teste para garantir que sua instalação do LaTeX está em ordem e, depois, começar a preparar sua apresentação para o LatinR!\n\n\nComo enviar o artigo\nAté aqui, o latinr permite criar um PDF com o template da conferência e corretamente anonimizado para envio. Você pode enviar esse PDF manualmente acessando a página do EasyChair, mas se quiser, pode fazê-lo usando o latinr.\nEm qualquer caso, você precisará criar uma conta no EasyChair. Depois, tem a opção de salvar seus dados de conta com latinr::latinr_password_set(), que pedirá seu usuário e senha. Isso não é obrigatório, mas facilita o processo. É possível que você precise instalar o pacote keyring, caso em que um erro informativo será exibido.\nFinalmente, o envio é realizado com latinr::latinr_submit(). Por"

    "title": "The latinr package lets you create and submit presentations to LatinR",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introducing: latinr, the R package\nIn this edition of LatinR we showcase a new way of submit presentations entirely from your R session!\nThe aim is to make the whole process of creating, formatting and submitting your work as easy as possible. With the latinr package you can write your presentation using R Markdown adding the submission details in the header, compile it to PDF using the conference template and then submit it without the need of filling any form.\nNote that none of this is at all mandatory. If you don’t feel comfortable using R Markdown, you can use whatever other tool you enjoy to create your PDF, and if you prefer, you can always use the EasyChair web interface to submit your work.\nAlso note that article submission is somewhat experimental at the moment, which means that if you do use it, go to the EasyChair website to be certain that your submission is correct.\n\nCreating LatinR submissions with latinr\nFirst things first, you need to install the package using devtools::install_github(\"latinr/latinr\").\nIf you use RStudio, you can create an R Markdown template by going to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; From Template and selection “LatinR submission article”. There, you can name your file, select its folder and then press OK to create a base file you can begin to complete.\nYou’ll notice that all the submission details are handled by the header. You can complete them there or the function latinr::latinr_wizard() to launch a graphical user interface that will guide you through the process and finally show you a valid header that you can copy and paste into your file.\n\n\n\nlatinr wizard\n\n\nAlternatively you can use the wizard and click “Save” (on the top-right corner) to create the same base file but pre-populated. In any case, the R Markdown file should look something like this:\n\n\n\nlatinr file skeleton\n\n\nThe first chunk performs some basic checks on the metadata each time the file is rendered. We recommend to leave it there so that any error comes to light as soon as possible. The rest is the R Markdown demo document. You can “knit” it to test that you’ve got the proper LaTeX installation and then start writing your presentation for LatinR!\n\n\nSubmitting an article with latinr\nSo far, latinr allows you to create a correctly anonymised PDF following the conference template. You can send it manually through the EasyChair website or, if you like, using latinr.\nIn any case, you’ll need to sing up at EasyChair. Then, you can optionally save your login details using lating::latinr_password_set(), which will promt you for your username and password. This is not mandatory but can make things easier. You might need to install que keyring package, in which case you’ll get an informative error.\nFinally, the submission is done with latinr::latinr_submit(). By default it checks if there’s a single .Rmd file in the current working directory and, if it finds it, takes it as the file to be submitted. Then, it will should you the submission details so you can check that everything is correct, it then renders and shows you the resulting PDF so you can also verify it, and finally it performs the submission.\nOptionally, in case you have a PDF created by any other medium, you can pass its path as an argument and use the .Rmd only to populate the submission details.\nAs we said before, this process is somewhat experimental an integration with web forms is notoriously complex. For that reason, it is of the utmost importance that you go to the EasyChair website to ascertain that your submission has gone through correctly. In the event of any error, you can always correct them manually.\n\n\nAbsolutely optional\nEach step of the process is completely optional. You can use latinr to create and submit your work, only to create it, only to submit it, or not at all. Do whatever makes you more comfortable!\nBut if you do use latinr and find any error o have any suggestion, then don’t hesitate to contact us! The best way is by opening an issue on the GitHub repository or sending us a message through our Slack, or you can email the package maintainer with packageDescription(\"latinr\")$Maintainer. This is all new to us and we wish to leverage the community to improve it for the future!"

    "text": "By Allison Horst, Curtis Kephart, and Yanina Bellini\nCross-posted:\n\n\n\nBirds of a Feather banner for RStudio::conf(2020)!\n\n\nThe “Birds of a Feather” (BoF) sessions at the 2020 RStudio Conference were a place where R-users with similar backgrounds, interests, and aspirations could connect in a low-stress social setting. In other words - these sessions let “birds of a feather flock together.” Building on the 2019 conference swag, we rolled out a bunch of new BoF buttons for rstudio::conf 2020.\nHere we’ll share the process for how some of the designs were created, including several that truly involved a flock of contributors (names for groups of birds are from Bird Spot).\n\nWell, what can we realistically fit on a 1.5” button?\nThe cool and challenging thing about designing the BoF buttons was the size restriction. In a 1.5” button, we wanted to create designs that:\n\nReflect the group name and/or community\nInclude at least one bird\nAre obviously distinguishable for each group\nAdd some readable text\nOh also, all while setting an approachable tone.\n\nIt turns out the answer to “What can you fit on a 1.5” button?” is…actually quite a lot. Here are a few of the designs:\n\n\nData science team leaders\nFeaturing 80’s beach volleyball sandpiper coach leading a team of R users:\n\n\n\nFun fact: a group of sandpipers can be called a fling or a bind.\n\n\nNatural language processing\nFeaturing a wordy bird - a parrot!\n\n\n\nFun facts: Groups of parrots are sometimes called companies, a prattles, or pandemoniums. Also, parrots are the only birds that can use their feet (like hands) to serve themselves food. And one more thing - the text in the background of this design is a line from Patrick Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind (one of artist @allison_horst’s favorite books).\n\n\nThe spatially aware carrier pigeon…\n…checking flight routes before setting off on their next delivery:\n\n\n\nFun fact: A group of pigeons is sometimes called a kit or a loft.\n\n\nCommunity-driven designs\nSeveral of the designs - especially R-Latin America, R-Africa, and R-Ladies - depended on recommendations, insights, and feedback from multiple members of those communities. Here, we’ll highlight elements and contributors of several community-driven designs.\n\nR-Latin America\n\n\n\nThe R-Latin America BoF button was truly a collaborative effort, with every detail - from bird to branch - created based on ideas and input from R-Latin America community members. Massive thanks to the R-Latin America design contributors (and thank you to @yabellini for providing this compiled list & text):\nLaura Ación, Marcela Alfaro, Yanina Bellini, Juliana Benitez (expert ornithologist!), Elio Campitelli, Paola Corrales, Florencia D’Andrea, Natalia da Silva, Priscilla Minotti; Riva Quiroga, Vilma Romero, Gabriela Sandoval, Heather Turner; and the LatinR Conference Community!\nThese contributors are from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Perú, Uruguay and the UK, and belong to R-Ladies Chapters and R User Groups in these countries. The final picture was chosen for the vote of the broader LatinR Conference Community.\nHere are some insights into the final design elements:\n\nThe bird species is the chingolo (Zonotrichia capensis) which was chosen because it seemed to be the bird that is native to many Latin American countries, and is also unique to Latin America. It was one of a number suggested by ornithologist Juliana Benitez!\nThe chingolo is standing on a tilde (“~”) branch, used in letter eñe (ñ)\nThe color bands on the tilde represent colors on flags for Latin American countries\nThe shape of Latin America is represented on the bird’s chest\nThe bright green background is a nod to the astonishing biodiversity in Latin America\n\n\n\nAfricaR\n\n\n\nThe AfricaR BoF button was designed with suggestions and feedback from AfricaR community leaders Shelmith Kariuki and Dennis Irorere.\nSome design elements for the AfricaR button:\n\nThe colors (orange, purple and black) are borrowed from (and inspired by) the existing Africa R Users hex design\nThe shape of the continent is in orange (and outlined by data points, with a ggplot-inspired background grid)\nThe ostrich was suggested by Shelmith and Dennis as a representative bird\n\n\n\nR-Ladies\n\n\n\nThe R-Ladies BoF button started with an idea from R-Ladies founder Gabriela de Quiroz, who suggested a gull as a nod to both R-Ladies’ beginnings in San Francisco, and to this year’s conference location!\nWith feedback from Gabriela and the R-Ladies leadership team including Laura Ación and Erin LeDell, and RStudio’s Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, the final design features the following elements:\n\nA flock (or colony) of gulls, species chosen because it’s common to San Francisco, where R-Ladies began!\nThe gulls are riding an updraft of air together\nThe purple-to-black gradient is inspired by the R-Ladies color scheme\n\n\n\nThe whole collection\nThis year, there were 24(!) different Birds of a Feather buttons. When we put them all together, here’s the flock for the 2020 conference (with more planned for next year):\n\n\n\nWe hope that everyone can find a bird that they relate to, and we look forward to meeting many of you at future RStudio Conference BoF sessions!\nSo, just one final question: Which bird(s) are you?"

Those who participate in this modality will have 20 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A. \n\n\nLightning Talks\nLightning talks provide an opportunity to present and discuss advances, ideas, ongoing research, experiences and challenges related to LatinR’s topics. Those who participate in this modality will have 5 minutes for the presentation. Lightning talks will be grouped into thematic sessions that will include a final round of Q&A. \n\n\nPosters\nLike Lightning Talks, the posters provide an opportunity to present progress and ongoing projects related to LatinR’s topics. During the conference there will be a time block for the presentation of posters and dialogue with the audience. \n\n\n\nSubmitting a proposal\n\nAll the proposals will have to be submitted as a PDF, without authors’ names nor their affiliations, letter sized document, typed using a font size 11 and single line spacing. Maximum 2 pages.\nThere is a package developed by Elio Campitelli that allows you to create the abstract as an R Markdown file. You can see the details here. In previous editions, it was possible to send the abstracts directly from RStudio; however, due to changes with the previous platform (EasyChair), we will be using a new one (Open Review) and the automated submission won’t be available.\n\nIf you prefer using a different text editor, we kindly ask you to use this template.\n\nThe submissions will be accepted via the Open Review platform. You will have to register before hand. Please, do this as soon as you can, as the account activation on Open Review can take up to 24 hours.\nFor those sending proposals authored by more than one person, only one of them has to sign up on Open Review.\nYou can only submit one proposal as the main author, but you are welcome to contribute as the co-author of two other submissions.\nAll the submissions will be carefully reviewed by the Scientific Committee (soon to be announced), considering their originallity, contributions, quality and clarity. \n\n\n\nKey dates\nSubmission deadline: June 30th, 2023\nAcceptation notice: early August 2023"

    "text": "Cross-posted:\nThis useR!2020 session and video was organized by Laura Acion, Yanina Bellini Saibene, Paola Corrales, and Paloma Rojas Saunero. Leonardo Collado Torres coordinated the blog post submission. This blog post was originally submitted to the R Consortium blog and published there on July 7th 2020.\nOn June 19th 2020 we filmed a video for useR!2020 showcasing the communities and organizations we are involved in that are for Latin Americans or have Latin American participants. In this blog post, we wanted to highlight these initiatives and remind everyone that we are more than happy to help you launch similar initiatives in your local communities.\n\n\nLatinR: LatinR is a trilingual international conference on the use of R in research and development across Latin America. Since launching in 2018, our annual meetings have been a starting point for new packages, local user groups, reading clubs, R-Ladies chapters, translations, and other initiatives in the region.\nConectaR: ConectaR 2019 took place during January 24-26, 2019 at the University of Costa Rica, in San José, Costa Rica. It was the first event in Central America endorsed by The R Foundation, and it was held completely in Spanish. You can find more information here.\nsatRday: satRday is a conference about R and its applications, that happens all over the world, and it is organized by the local community. Two satRdays events happened in Latin America: in Santiago - Chile and São Paulo - Brazil. If you want to organize a satRday anywhere in Latin America, please get it touch so we can help each other!\nR-Ladies: R-Ladies is a global organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community. It has 123 active chapters in 51 countries around the world, of which 49 are found across 10 Latin American countries. Some Latin Americans are part of the R-Ladies Global Team, including its leadership. COVID-19 has not stopped us, instead, we have migrated online and fostered alliances among different chapters. All in an effort to give gender minorities in the R community the opportunity to learn R in a safe and supportive environment. Join us!\nrOpenSci: R for open science, rOpenSci, provides free technical review of R packages to improve the quality of open source software in order to maximize readability, usability, usefulness, and minimize redundancy. Their peer-review process will soon be translated to Spanish and you can get involved!\nCDSB: the Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB in Spanish) was born in 2018 with the goal of helping Latin American R users become R & Bioconductor developers and increase the representation of Latinx in these communities. For more information about CDSB check bit.ly/cdsbpost2020.\nRUGs: there are several R User Groups in Latin America, some of which are officially sponsored by the R Consortium. We believe that creating a welcoming space is crucial for keeping the ideas flowing, which allows for meaningful networking and, consequently, the development of new projects. We can help you start your own group!\nR4DS in Spanish + datos package: the resources to learn R in English are many, awesome, online, and free. But in Latin America few people can afford to learn English, and the resources in Spanish are few. To help solve this problem, we community-translated to Spanish the “R for Data Science” book and developed a package with the translation of all the datasets used in it: datos. The workflow to contribute to the package was designed to engage first-time contributors, and is now guiding the development of a new version in Portuguese that will be released in the next few months.\n#DatosDeMiércoles + #30díasdegráficos: The @R4DS_es Twitter account was created as a way to share projects like the R4DS translation and to develop initiatives to foster the Spanish-speaking R community, like #datosdemieRcoles, the Latin American cousin of #TidyTuesday. The idea is not only to use datasets that are in Spanish, but also datasets that are relevant for our Region. This initiative has been complemented with the 30 days plot challenge #30díasdegráficos. If you want to participate proposing a dataset for #datodemiéRcoles, please visit our github repo.\nThe Carpentries: The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. Building a sustainable and active community in Latin America includes several initiatives: lesson translations, instructor training, workshop coordination, and fundraising. Get in touch with us through the mailing list and the carpentries-es channel at the Carpentries Slack workspace.\nReproHack: ReproHack is a growing community for researchers that are fighting the reproducibility crisis by sharing their experiences across disciplines. It is focused on organizing hackathons where participants attempt to reproduce published research from a list of proposed papers with public code and data. We are planning the first ReproHack in Spanish for October 2020 and you can get in touch with us through Twitter.\nAI Inclusive: AI Inclusive is an organization that promotes diversity in the AI Community. We want to bring awareness around Artificial Intelligence issues and empower the community so they can enter in the AI field, a field that is not diverse at all. In December 2019, we had our launch events in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and San Francisco, California. Follow us and join us!\nData Latam: in May 2016 we started with the first Data Latam podcast, aimed at offering an easy entry point, in Spanish, to those interested in data science. We always ask our interviewees: “How did you get where you are?”, and the diversity of stories has been enormous. Today Data Latam is a Latin American community of professionals and academics, who apply data science in their day to day work and we invite you to participate!\n\nWhat happens in the R Community doesn’t stay in the R Community. All the good practices of inclusive and diverse communities learned in several of the initiatives presented before, generate strong work teams within and beyond the R community. There is still a lot to be done, but what we’ve already achieved is very encouraging and provides a solid foundation for the future.\nThese initiatives are sustained by many people making a great, mostly volunteer, effort behind the scenes. Some of the challenges that the communities face are translated into multiple positives, sustained, and a lot of invisible hard work. Some of them are: finding international funding due to limited local options, translating content, joining forces across organizations, organizing regional conferences, and becoming active developers of the technology.\nThe Latin American R community is growing fast and so does the responsibility to make this growth solid and safe. Some of the future work that we, as community builders, look forward to fulfilling are: consolidating regional conferences with support of international sponsors; acquiring funding to sustain translations; amplifying the voices of regional minorities; importing educational material and work opportunities; connecting expats with their local communities; helping other groups such as RUGs and RLadies; connecting with other initiatives such as R-Forwards, Africa-R, MiR, among others; Increase our and other minorities representation in the R Core Team, the R Foundation, and the R Consortium.\nThank you! Please watch our useR! 2020 video on YouTube."

We suggest not to leave account creation to the last minute.\n\n\n\n\nPresentation Formats\n\nOral Communications\nPresentations on research results, progress reports, or specific developments that, due to their originality or potential application and impact on the use or development of R in academia or industry, are of interest to the regional R community. Participants in this format will have 20 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for dialogue with the audience. \n\n\nLightning Talks\nLightning talks provide an opportunity to present and discuss advancements, ideas, ongoing research, experiences, and challenges related to the themes of LatinR. Participants in this format will have 5 minutes for their presentation. Lightning talks will be grouped into thematic sessions that will include time at the end for a round of questions.\n\n\nWorkshops\nDetails for those who wish to propose online workshops for this edition of LatinR will be shared soon.\n\n\n\nProposal Submission Guidelines\n\nAll works must be submitted in PDF format, without authors or affiliation, in letter size, written in font size 11 with single spacing. The length must not exceed two pages.\nThere is a package developed by Elio Campitelli that allows the abstract to be prepared in an RMarkdown file. You can check the details in this post.
